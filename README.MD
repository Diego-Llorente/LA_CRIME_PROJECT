Business Case:
Criminality in LA is quite high every year. The mayor Karen Bass, as big part of her program, wants to decrease it ! Our goal is to provide data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to help reduce incidents within the population of LA.

Objectives:
We investigated LAPD crime reports from two periods of time (2017 to 2019 after cleaning; and 2020 to 2024) to see if any correlation could be found between presidents from different political parties and the criminality in a democrat city like LA.

Our main approaches were focused on:
Locations of the crimes
Period of the day
Type of crimes
Weapons used
Sex, age and ethnicity of the victims

Data Cleaning:
We filtered and cleaned over 3M rows of data, focusing on:
dates, areas, crime codes, victims info, weapons used, premises, location
We classified weapons, crimes, and locations into main categories

Analysis:
We analyzed the different approaches mentioned above, showing the results with either bar graphs or pie graphs
We conducted cross-sectional analyses to explore heat maps of weapons / crimes and area / crimes

Key Findings:
Crimes happen almost as much in residential areas as in public places
The crimes are peaking at night 
The most common crimes are theft-related followed by violent crimes
Usually no weapons are used (bare-hands)
The victims are more likely to be male / hispanic / 30 years old

Recommendations:
Deploy security cameras on the streets 
Better lighting of the street at night
Increase patrols in the residential areas and public areas during nighttime to dissuade criminality
